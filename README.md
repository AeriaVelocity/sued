# sued - Shut Up Editor

**sued is not exactly ready. It doesn't even open files yet.**

A text editor that ~~works~~ will work and ~~is~~ will be an editor.

Syntax highlighting? Code analysis? *Modal editing?* **Cursor positioning??**

Who the hell cares? Just shut up and edit.

> :warning: Only use sued if you like pain. Nothing comes for granted with this program.

Written in Rust, because frick you, that's why.
