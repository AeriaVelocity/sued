# sued - Shut Up Editor

**sued currently has no editor functionality, so. . . don't use it yet.**

A text editor that ~~works~~ will work and ~~is~~ will be an editor.

Syntax highlighting? Code analysis? *Modal editing?* **Cursor positioning??**

Who the hell cares? Just shut up and edit.

> :warning: Only use sued if you like pain. Nothing comes for granted with this program.
