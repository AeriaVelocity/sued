        <h1>NAME</h1>
        <p>sued - the text editor of all time, a post-classic line editor</p>
        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
        <p>sued [file]</p>
        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>sued is a line editor written in Rust by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io">Arsalan Kazmi</a> in the image of the standard text editor, ed.</p>
        <p>sued is not nearly as powerful as its inspiration, but it matches it in the terseness department, while at the same time being quite a bit more user-friendly.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that sued is not that fully-featured, and is still in early stages of development, however, it's still very usable!</p>
        <h1>OBTAINING</h1>
        <p>sued is available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sued">crates.io</a> - you can get it with <strong>cargo install sued</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/that1m8head/sued">Go to the GitHub page</a> if you want to check out sued for yourself, or if you want to help me work on it.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why a line editor?</li>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I like ed. I find it extremely pleasant to use, despite its terseness. I wanted to try my hand at writing a similar text editor, just a lot less complex.</li>
                        <li>I don't want to go insane trying to develop a Vim-like editor. Especially not when projects like <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> exist.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <li>If it's ed-like, why not copy ed's syntax?</li>
                <p>sued is actually more modelled after my earlier attempt at a line editor, <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/Streakline">Streakline</a>. In Streakline, editing is straightforward. You open the editor and start typing. It used commands prefixed with ~, so sued does too.</p>
                <li>What does sued stand for?</li>
                <p>It stands for "shut up editor". This can be read as "shut up and edit", "the shut up editor" or "Shut up, editor!"</p>
                <li>How do you pronounce sued?</li>
                <p>"soo-ed". Don't pronounce it "sood". Otherwise people are going to think a text editor's going to go to court(!)</p>
                <li>"Post-classic"?</li>
                <p>It's a play on words, since Helix describes itself as "post-modern" -- sued is "post-classic".</p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
        <p>When an error occurs that sued can't recover from, it will print an error message as follows and quit:</p>
        <p>stop: ERROR_CODE: 0xXXXXXXXX (0xXXXXXXXX,0xXXXXXXXX,0xXXXXXXXX)</p>
        <p>The currently implemented error codes are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>USER_IS_STUPID</strong> - The user manually initiated a crash.</li>
            <li><strong>EDITOR_OVERFLOW</strong> - The editor tried to run itself and got stuck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
        <p>sued can't really do much in terms of "editing" text. It can write to files fine, but you can't exactly change file contents. Is that enough information on its limitations?</p>
        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>sued was, technically speaking, initially developed at the University of Hertfordshire (because I'm a student there), but practically speaking it wasn't developed under their watch or on their systems, or even for them. sued is a project by me, Arsalan Kazmi, first and foremost, no matter where it's worked on from, and UH holds no copyright over it.</p>
        <h1>BUGS</h1>
        <p>Yes.</p>
