        <h1>NAME</h1>
        <p>sued - the shut up editor</p>

        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
        <p>sued [file]</p>

        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>sued is a stateless vector-oriented command-based text editor written in Rust, with focus on speed, simplicity, ease of use and staying the hell out of your way. It's inspired by more contemporary editors, such as the ed family (ed, em, ex, vi, Vim, Neovim, etc.).</p>
        <p>To be clear, it's a text editor that works on Rust's <code>Vec</code> type. To be clearer, it's a text editor that works on lines and isn't graphical, like you're probably used to.</p>

        <h1>SITE NAVIGATION</h1>
        <p>This website supports <code>vi</code>-style key navigation.</p>
        <ul>

            <li><code>G</code> - Scroll to the end</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>OBTAINING</h1>
        <p>sued is available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sued">crates.io</a> - you can get it with <strong>cargo install sued</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/AeriaVelocity/sued">Go to the GitHub page</a> if you want to check out sued for yourself, or if you want to help me work on it.</p>
        
        <h1>OPTIONS</h1>
        <p>The following options are available:</p>
        <p><em>file</em> - Specify the name of a file to read. If set, sued will store the file name.</p>
        
        <h1>DEMO</h1>
        <p>You can view an <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/612006">asciinema</a> demo showing sued in action.</p>
        <p>This demo used to be embedded, but I couldn't get it to work right. Plus it kind of spoils the man page-ness of this website.</p>

        <h1>USAGE</h1>
        <p>To run sued, simply run <code>sued</code> at the command line.</p>
        <p>Upon starting sued, you'll be greeted by the startup message.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            $ sued <br>
            sued v0.16.0 - it's pronounced "soo-ed" <br>
            type ~ for commands, otherwise just start typing <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Once you're here, you can just begin typing up your text file.</p>
        <p>sued will automatically be pushing it onto the file buffer vector.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            This text is <br>
            getting pushed <br>
            onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>If you want to look at your work so far, use the <code>~show</code> command.</p>
        <p>Commands in sued are, by default, prefixed with ~. (though you can change that)</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Saving is straightforward too. You just enter <code>~save filename</code>.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~save sued-test.txt <br>
            saved to sued-text.txt <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Don't like how your commands are on the same line as the outputs? You can always set a <code>~prompt</code>.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~prompt sued> <br>
            sued> ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Let's see if we can make a correction. We'll use the <code>~replace</code> command.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            sued> ~replace 3 <br>
            replacing line 3 <br>
            original line is onto the file buffer! <br>
            into the file buffer vector! <br>
            replaced <br>
            sued> ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│into the file buffer vector! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>And that's all for this quick overview. Give sued a go and try it out yourself. The full command set awaits you down below.</p>

        <h1 id="tilde-range-syntax">TILDE RANGE SYNTAX</h1>
        <p>Tilde Range Syntax (TRS) allows you to specify a range of lines to operate on using simple tilde syntax.</p>
        <p>TRS looks like this, using the ~show command as an example:</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~show 1 <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            ~show 2~ <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
            ~show ~2 <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            ~show 2~3 <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>You can use TRS to specify only one line (X), all lines including and following a specific line (X~), all lines leading up to and including a specific line (~X), or a specific range of lines (X~Y).</p>
        <p>TRS was implemented into sued v0.17.0 as a way to concisely represent line ranges without having to deal with argument trouble, while also making it feel sued-y.</p>

        <h1>COMMANDS</h1>
        <p>sued supports command history. Use ↑ and ↓ to navigate through it.</p>
        <p>All commands start with ~. Run ~ by itself to see a list of commands.</p>
        <p>You can change sued's command prefix with <strong>~prefix [prefix]</strong>. Replace ~ with your chosen prefix in this case.</p>
        <p>All parameters marked "range" use <a href="#tilde-range-syntax">Tilde Range Syntax (TRS)</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>KEY:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>~command arg1/alt_arg2 [optional_arg]</strong> - what the command does</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why a line editor?</li>
                <p>I like ed. It's really nice, and the minimalism is really what sells it. I wanted to try my hand at writing a similar text editor, just a lot less complex.</p>
                <p>Plus, I don't want to go insane trying to develop a Vim-like editor. Especially not when projects like <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> exist.</p>
                <li>If it's ed-like, why not copy ed's syntax?</li>
                <p>ed has a lot of commands, and like I said, I want sued to be more user-friendly.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, sued inherits its command prefix (~) from my earlier project, <a href="https://github.com/AeriaVelocity/Streakline">Streakline</a>.</p>
                <li>What does sued stand for?</li>
                <p>It stands for "shut up editor," which alludes to how not-in-your-way it is.</p>
                <li>How do you pronounce sued?</li>
                <p>"soo-ed". Don't pronounce it "sood," it's not a law thing, and has nothing to do with GitHub Copilot. (The context behind that statement is weird.)</p>
                <li>Now that you're working on <a href="https://github.com/AeriaVelocity/QVSED">QVSED</a>, will sued be forgotten about?</li>
                <p>Pfft. No. QVSED is a <em>graphical</em> editor with a completely different paradigm, and it isn't a sued replacement. It's just another project.</p>
            </ul>

        <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
        <p>sued is still 0.x software and probably isn't going to replace your favourite code editor anytime soon.</p>
        <p>And as a line editor, it's not gonna have fancy features like a visual editing pane, complex syntax highlighting, an LSP client, AI assistance, code folding, or pretty much anything that's in VS Code.</p>
        <p>sued is not a conventional text editor, it isn't a VS Code replacement, it isn't a Vim or Emacs replacement, it isn't even an ed replacement.</p>
        <p>What it is, is sued. It edits text. Thanks and have fun.</p>
