        <h1>NAME</h1>
        <p>sued - the text editor of all time, a post-classic line editor</p>
        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
        <p>sued [file]</p>
        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>sued is a vector-oriented line editor written in Rust by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io">Arsalan Kazmi</a> in the image of the standard text editor, ed.</p>
        <p>sued is not nearly as powerful as its inspiration, but it matches it in the terseness department, while at the same time being quite a bit more user-friendly.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that sued is not that fully-featured, and is still in early stages of development, however, it's still very usable!</p>
        <h1>OBTAINING</h1>
        <p>sued is available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sued">crates.io</a> - you can get it with <strong>cargo install sued</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/that1m8head/sued">Go to the GitHub page</a> if you want to check out sued for yourself, or if you want to help me work on it.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why a line editor?</li>
                <p>I like ed. It's really nice, and the minimalism is really what sells it. I wanted to try my hand at writing a similar text editor, just a lot less complex.</p>
                <p>Plus, I don't want to go insane trying to develop a Vim-like editor. Especially not when projects like <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> exist.</p>
                <li>If it's ed-like, why not copy ed's syntax?</li>
                <p>ed has a lot of commands, and like I said, I want sued to be more user-friendly.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, sued inherits its command prefix (~) from my earlier project, <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/Streakline">Streakline</a>.</p>
                <li>What does sued stand for?</li>
                <p>It stands for "shut up editor," which alludes to how not-in-your-way it is.</p>
                <li>How do you pronounce sued?</li>
                <p>"soo-ed". Don't pronounce it "sood," it's not a law thing, and has nothing to do with GitHub Copilot. (The context behind that statement is weird.)</p>
                <li>Now that you're working on <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/QVSED">QVSED</a>, will sued be forgotten about?</li>
                <p>Pfft. No. QVSED is a <em>graphical</em> editor with a completely different paradigm, and it isn't a sued replacement. It's just another project.</p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
        <p>When an error occurs that sued can't recover from, it will print an error message as follows and quit:</p>
        <p>stop: ERROR_CODE: 0xXXXXXXXX (0xXXXXXXXX,0xXXXXXXXX,0xXXXXXXXX)</p>
        <p>The currently implemented error codes are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>USER_IS_STUPID</strong> - The user manually initiated a crash.</li>
            <li><strong>EDITOR_OVERFLOW</strong> - The editor tried to run itself and got stuck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
        <p>sued is still 0.x software and probably isn't going to replace VS Code anytime soon.</p>
        <h1>BUGS</h1>
        <p>Yes.</p>
