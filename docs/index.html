        <h1>NAME</h1>
        <p>sued - the shut up editor</p>

        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
        <p>sued [file]</p>

        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>sued is a vector-oriented line editor, kind of similar to the venerable and standard ed text editor, just with a different command syntax and set, to provide a unique editing experience.</p>
        <p>To be clear, it's a text editor that works on Rust's <code>Vec</code> type. To be clearer, it's a text editor that works on lines and isn't graphical, like you're probably used to.</p>

        <h1>OBTAINING</h1>
        <p>sued is available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sued">crates.io</a> - you can get it with <strong>cargo install sued</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/that1m8head/sued">Go to the GitHub page</a> if you want to check out sued for yourself, or if you want to help me work on it.</p>
        
        <h1>OPTIONS</h1>
        <p>The following options are available:</p>
        <p><em>file</em> - Specify the name of a file to read. If set, sued will store the file name.</p>
        
        <h1>DEMO</h1>
        <p>Here's an asciinema demo showing sued in action:</p>
        <script async id="asciicast-hCue12yNkc6PYUMcC6jSVUplS" src="https://asciinema.org/a/hCue12yNkc6PYUMcC6jSVUplS.js" data-autoplay="true" data-rows="28" data-cols="85"></script>
        </p>

        <h1>USAGE</h1>
        <p>To run sued, simply run <code>sued</code> at the command line.</p>
        <p>Upon starting sued, you'll be greeted by the startup message.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            $ sued <br>
            sued v0.16.0 - it's pronounced "soo-ed" <br>
            type ~ for commands, otherwise just start typing <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Once you're here, you can just begin typing up your text file.</p>
        <p>sued will automatically be pushing it onto the file buffer vector.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            This text is <br>
            getting pushed <br>
            onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>If you want to look at your work so far, use the <code>~show</code> command.</p>
        <p>Commands in sued are, by default, prefixed with ~. (though you can change that)</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Saving is straightforward too. You just enter <code>~save filename</code>.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~save sued-test.txt <br>
            saved to sued-text.txt <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Don't like how your commands are on the same line as the outputs? You can always set a <code>~prompt</code>.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            ~prompt sued> <br>
            sued> ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│onto the file buffer! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>Let's see if we can make a correction. We'll use the <code>~replace</code> command.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
            sued> ~replace 3 <br>
            replacing line 3 <br>
            original line is onto the file buffer! <br>
            into the file buffer vector! <br>
            replaced <br>
            sued> ~show <br>
            1│This text is <br>
            2│getting pushed <br>
            3│into the file buffer vector! <br>
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>And that's all for this quick overview. Give sued a go and try it out yourself. The full command set awaits you down below.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why a line editor?</li>
                <p>I like ed. It's really nice, and the minimalism is really what sells it. I wanted to try my hand at writing a similar text editor, just a lot less complex.</p>
                <p>Plus, I don't want to go insane trying to develop a Vim-like editor. Especially not when projects like <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> exist.</p>
                <li>If it's ed-like, why not copy ed's syntax?</li>
                <p>ed has a lot of commands, and like I said, I want sued to be more user-friendly.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, sued inherits its command prefix (~) from my earlier project, <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/Streakline">Streakline</a>.</p>
                <li>What does sued stand for?</li>
                <p>It stands for "shut up editor," which alludes to how not-in-your-way it is.</p>
                <li>How do you pronounce sued?</li>
                <p>"soo-ed". Don't pronounce it "sood," it's not a law thing, and has nothing to do with GitHub Copilot. (The context behind that statement is weird.)</p>
                <li>Now that you're working on <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/QVSED">QVSED</a>, will sued be forgotten about?</li>
                <p>Pfft. No. QVSED is a <em>graphical</em> editor with a completely different paradigm, and it isn't a sued replacement. It's just another project.</p>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
        <p>sued is still 0.x software and probably isn't going to replace VS Code anytime soon.</p>
        <p>Plus, it's a line editor. If a text editor nowadays isn't kitted with a visual editing pane, thousands of keyboard shortcuts, an LSP client, auto-completion, syntax highlighting, code folding, and everything else VS Code users take for granted, it's deemed as "unusable" and "outdated" by novice programmers. In which case, sued probably isn't for them.</p>
        <p>sued isn't a modern code editor, and it isn't trying to be. It's trying to be an unconventional line editor, and it doesn't give a damn if you're not comfortable with that.</p>
        <h1>BUGS</h1>
